Title: All your storage are belong to Ansible

Abstract:
Today's datacenters are filled with storage arrays that speak different languages.
Even a workflow as simple as provisioning a LUN is vendor specific, non-portable,
and can be difficult to automate.  Ansible provides a robust community and rich
platform for developing portable automation and with some secret sauce we can create
a volume on any storage backend using the same playbook.  In this talk Adam will
introduce the quarry[1] Ansible role, show how it works, and demonstrate how to
add support for new storage backends and new storage operations.

Track:
Open source storage

Length:
30 min

Level:
Intermediate

Audience:
This talk is aimed at systems administrators and software developers who need to
manage storage arrays or other IT infrastructure.  Basic knowledge of storage
provisioning and Ansible is assumed.

Bio:
Adam began his career as a Linux kernel developer focused on memory management.
Over the years he has contributed to many projects including: linux, libhugetlbfs,
qemu, libvirt, memory overcommitment manager (mom), and oVirt.  These days, Adam
works at Red Hat on storage virtualization for oVirt.  He enjoys writing code that
is resilient to the everyday mayhem in datacenters such as power failure, network
outages, and under-caffienated sysadmins.


Outline:

About enterprise storage:
 - Lots of vendors (screenshot of vendor logos)
 - Lots of neat features (cloud of storage features)
 - Lots of APIs (screenshots of the interfaces used to provision volumes)

Problem
 - How can we build common tooling to achieve
    - Better automation and management in IT and DevOps
    - Broad vendor support and effient control plane operations for virtualization and container orchestration
 - Openstack has achieved this for itself with Cinder but it's hard to use outside of Openstack

Solution
 - Abstraction!
 - Standardized set of cinder-like operations
 - Ansible as common ground
   - Low deployment complexity
   - Easily integrates with software and processes
   - Active collaborative community

Quarry
 - Ansible Role to abstract storage provisioning using templating
 - Playbooks define operations to be executed against storage targets

Operations
 - Defines a storage provisioning action that may need to be performed
 - Create / Delete volume
 - Attach / Detach volume
 - Create / Delete snapshot

Backends
 - A kind of storage system with a unique way of performing operations
 - Ceph
 - Gluster
 - Netapp Data ONTAP
 - Dell EMC XtremIO
 - IBM DS8000

Targets
 - An instance of a backend defined by configuration parameters
   - API URL
   - Credentials
   - Namespace (cluster / pool / vserver)

Configure a new target

Create a volume

Delete the volume

Configure a second target

Change original playbooks to use the new target
